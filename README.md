🚗 Smart Parking Occupancy Detection System
📌 Project Overview



The Smart Parking Occupancy Detection System is a Computer vision–based application designed to identify free and occupied parking slots from images or video streams.
This system helps reduce traffic congestion, saves time for drivers, and supports smart city infrastructure.

The application uses image processing techniques and machine learning logic to analyze parking areas and display real-time parking availability through an interactive Streamlit web interface.

🎯 Key Features

📷 Upload parking lot images or video frames

🟢 Detect Free parking slots

🔴 Detect Occupied parking slots

📊 Visual representation using bounding boxes

⚡ Fast and lightweight processing

🖥️ User-friendly Streamlit UI

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Pandas

Streamlit

PIL (Python Imaging Library)

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-parking-detection.git
cd smart-parking-detection

2️⃣ Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the application
streamlit run app.py

🖼️ How It Works

Upload a parking lot image

The system processes the image using computer vision

Parking slots are analyzed

Results are displayed as:

🟢 Free Slots

🔴 Occupied Slots

📊 Output Example

Bounding boxes drawn on parking slots

Live count of available and occupied spaces

Clean and interactive interface

📈 Future Enhancements

🎥 Real-time video stream detection

🧠 Deep Learning (YOLO / CNN-based detection)

📍 Slot auto-detection

🌐 IoT camera integration

📱 Mobile-friendly dashboard
